# Day13-Design-Doc
Day 13 was a debugging focused day with no core project, so I uploaded a tech spec/design doc for a game project for an operating systems class.
The tech spec outlines design constraints, system architecture, executive summary, domain model, development requirements and included all recommendations.
I will post a text file with all information copied over and also the docx file.
